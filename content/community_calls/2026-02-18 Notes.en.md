This call focused on recent DSC advancements, featuring live demos and
discussions around tooling improvements and the DSC V3.2 roadmap.

- **VS Code extension** (demo by Gijs): Improved DSC configuration
  editing with IntelliSense, MOF-to-V3 conversion, and resource
  manifest generation.
- **DSC Bicep extension** (demo by Andy): Enables orchestration of DSC
  resources using Bicep's local deploy feature, with type support and
  dependency resolution. Future plans include publishing to official
  registries.
- **DSC V3.2 roadmap** (Steve): Quality-driven release timeline with a
  planned Python adapter to broaden resource authoring beyond
  PowerShell, and future consideration for languages like C#.
- **Q&A highlights**: Clarified that Bicep handles orchestration and
  type resolution when using the DSC extension; discussed user-defined
  types and custom functions.
- **Action items**: Test `ak.ms` links for extension distribution and open
  the Bicep types project for community contributions.
